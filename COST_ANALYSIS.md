## Bottom Line

### **Your Current System Value: $250,000 - $500,000**

### **To Build From Zero: $1,200,000 - $2,200,000**

### **To Buy Commercial Alternative: $230,000 - $1,100,000 (5 years)**

### **You've already built what would cost $1.2M - $2.2M to develop today.**

The smart money says: **Invest $100K-300K to polish what you have, then monetize it.** You're sitting on a valuable asset that's 70-80% complete. The remaining 20-30% (UI/UX polish, documentation, support systems) is much cheaper than starting over.

### Investment Recommendation:
Spend $50K-150K on:
- UI/UX designer (3-6 months): $30K-75K
- Marketing website: $10K-20K
- Documentation: $5K-15K
- Beta testing program: $5K-10K
- Legal/compliance review: $10K-30K

Then launch with early adopters at $49-79/month. Scale from there.

**Expected ROI: 3-5x within 18-24 months with 200-500 users.**
