So im going to come back to the paper trade fixing and all of that right now I have this thing going on where logically it made the most sense.. So I basically am only doing market orders.. So im grabbing market order premiums from thetadata and also putting in market order on alpaca.. My system still works to where my system scans alpacas contract for its genuine entry price and places it as such in the ui correctly.. Its just whats still most likely broken is the exit premium and exit connection in general... ALSO the premium amount is incorrect slightly... its hard to explain.. My theory is that it was because it was trying to calculate mid price exit, but i was trying to exit at market order so the prices naturally didn't sync properly..
